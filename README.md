This project is designed to help a user to dynamically create categories with percent values of a whole. This might be used by a teacher to establish grading categories, or a gamer to calculate percent chance of an encounter among various options.

The project is currently unfinished. Right now, each new field is created with the appropriate new percentage, but I need to create the functions that will change each previous category's percentage value and the field where it is show on the html page. I also need to add these functions to the event listeners so that the percentages can change dynamically.

It should also create field validation such that the user can not raise the percentage to an amount that would push the total above 100.
